#+title: Hasliberg Theme

This is my personal theme setup, inspired by Swiss alps.

* Disclaimer
While I have the code setup shared here, I actually do not pull down the theme from this remote repository. The main purpose of this theme was to set up something I don't have any external dependency, so that I can have a same look and feel with bare Emacs session without any extra setup.

For that reason, this is only a mirror of what I manage separately, and may not be in the most up-to-date state.

I may consider managing this more in public in future, but again, this is not meant to suffice all different use cases, but specifically designed to my liking.
